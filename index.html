<p>A veteran, web developer, healthcare manager, entrepreneur, musician and fisherman, I began studying software development from the confines of an Air Force tent while deployed to Helmand Province, Afghanistan in 2012.</p>
<p>Since then, I've used platforms such as <a href="http://charleslueker.com">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://hartwelloutfitters.com">Shopify</a> for blogging and online sales management while getting aquainted HTML, CSS and Javascript. In April 2015, I completed an intensive 12 week Javascript course at the Iron Yard in Austin, TX where my skills were honed on the afore mentioned languages as well as on two Javascript frameworks: Angular and Backbone. To top it off, they even schooled me on some node.js and Sails.</p>

<h3>Who IS This Guy!?</h3>

<p>I grew up moving back and forth among several small towns across Southern Illinois as my Mom regularly cycled through taking jobs and going to school. An early appreciation for learning was instilled in the minds of both my brother and I as family conversations often revolved around religion, politics, science and art. Church was a big part of our upbringing and we could just as easily find ourselves at a Southern Baptist revival as a Society of Friends meeting.</p>
