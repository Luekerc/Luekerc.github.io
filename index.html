<h3>Purpose of This Web Portfolio</h3>
<p>This is my GitHub hosted website where I feature coding projects I want to show off. GitHub provides an open-source collaborative coding environment where you can follow me, see my learning progression and clone any projects you find particularly interesting to see how they work.  
</p> 

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>This site is optimized for use on mobile devices. That means it knows what size of device you are using and adjusts its formatting and content accordingly. If you visit this portfolio on a phone and then on your laptop, you'll see two different layouts. Shoot me an email if you'd like a quote on how I can do this for your site.</p>
<p>This site has links to various projects I want to feature. Many involve JavaScript and include descriptions of how that language is incoporated.</p>

<p>My first forray into software development began when I was 9 years old. I started learning <strong>BASIC</strong> on a <strong>Radio Shack TRS-80 </strong>computer. The pinnacle of my early programming was changing the color of the screen and repeating the same word down the left side. The unit featured arcade game ripoffs which were fun, but also kind of depressing. We couldn't afford to replace the TRS-80 once it died so I put programming aside for decades assuming it was only for upper middle class nerds in California. *sniffle*

<p>From the confines of an Air Force tent while deployed to Helmand Province, Afghanistan in 2012, I casually started reading up on more modern languages like <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. Since then, I've used platforms such as <a href="http://charleslueker.com">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://hartwelloutfitters.com">Shopify</a> for blogging and online sales. In April 2015, I completed an intensive 12 week <strong>JavaScript</strong> course at <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/austin/"> <strong>The Iron Yard</strong></a> in Austin, TX where my skills were honed on the afore mentioned languages as well as on associated frameworks: <strong>Node, Angular, Backbone</strong> and <strong>Sails</strong>.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of THIS GUY!</h3>

<p>Growing up, my family regularly moved back and forth among several small towns across Southern Illinois as my Mom cycled between jobs and university semesters. An early appreciation for learning was instilled within both my brother and me as family conversations often revolved around religion, ethics, politics, science and art. Church was a big part of our upbringing and we could just as easily find ourselves attending a Southern Baptist revival as a Society of Friends (Quaker) meeting.</p>
